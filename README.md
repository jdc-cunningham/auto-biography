# about me
This is kind of a weird thought on my part. Just thinking if GitHub will host stuff/be around for a while, not a bad place to put my "current mental state"/dreams/aspirations/etc...

I came from the Philippines, personal problems/luck/trauma/sadness/I'm here. I got educated as I was severely behind age-wise. Had a good childhood in Alaska/Wisconsin/New York.

Currently at age 28 I am an SWE in the midwest, mostly doing frontend(ReactJS/Rails). About 6 years ago I pretty much failed out of school... I was not focused, I was in a phys-eng co-op program and yeah... I was more concerned about going out/FOMO than my studies. At the time I was not really into computers... well before 2013 anyway. Mostly I just used it for some minor gaming like in 2007(Runescape) and a little later(Bioshock) but I never had a gaming computer because I couldn't afford them. A classmate actually sold me his older "gaming" computer that had like a Radeon 128MB card or something... it's back then when DDR2/20GB HDD was a thing. So yeah... I was building rc planes a lot that was my passion, those were the days where I genuinely felt happy being outside/flying. This was in the "early days" of FPV in 2012. It was kind of funny as at that time I couldn't afford these parts. The one day I finally had everything and my plane was ready(twin boom pusher) I was disappointed... when you see FPV videos it's usually the secondary footage and what you actually fly with in real time is the TVL camera with 480p or whatever... but yeah. I enjoy the flying/aerodynamics aspect more than piloting FPV.

So then I get the idea of trying to get rich by making high traffic websites... I learned HTML/CSS/JS and start to make some stuff... I had some really stupid/non-validated ideas... I just had like Silicon Valley/startup/Social Network thoughts in my head at the time but I failed... I was washing plates then got into a data entry role that paid a little more. But then I decided to escape/run away by bailing on my life. My finances imploded, credit score hit like low 400's possibly even lower.

Quick anecdote here:
In 2013 or so... at the time I was using like GoDaddy... didn't know how CSR/SSL worked, how to host stuff on my own VPS servers etc... just before I completely ate it financially I spent a lot of time just learning... I had the freedom since the frat house I was living in at the time had low rent. So I had time... and I learned a lot. I was trying to build dating sites and what not like I had the domain `dn2d8.com` at one point ha. This was a good time though ability to have freedom/time to learn. This was the time when I started to really figure out the backend eg. prepared statements so I had the LAMP stack under me at this point. Then after I crashed my car into a car while trying to drift on ice... I was broke/left for MO with like $1K in my pocket. That was a long bus ride from NY to MO.

I moved out to the midwest where my friend was stationed at an AF base. I slept on his couch for a bit... tried to do some freelance work, I got hits... but out of all the work I did say 12+ jobs... it only made me over $1K so it wasn't something I could live on... I had to work in a factory... then when we moved out to KS I worked in a kitchen again washing plates... then I got lucky and an agency hired me. That's where I did just over a year of heavy frontend/Wordpress work. Then I got lucky and was pinged for a position to work as a "senior software engineer" and I was like "that's not what I am" and also kept saying "I don't have a degree" but I still made it/got the job... the pay increase was insane to me. I had never made this much money before... this is more than entry level engineering jobs. Granted I'm a contractor/have no healthcare/etc... so I do eat it still.

Now I support some of my family in the Philippines. I keep working towards my goal of FIRE but mainly I want the freedom to build stuff. My fantasy I think at the moment is to own property in some "desert-like" area and build robotics/have them roam around autonomosly on the land whether in the air or on the ground. Generally just make more stuff.

Super future thoughts/interests:

* GAI
  * perhaps not full sentience either who can do that?
  * drones that roam the oceans
* AR
* Space
* consciousness transfer into machines(haha)
